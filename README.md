# Low-level Programming

 Holberton projects on C programming and Shell scripting, many of which are recreations of standard library functions

 ### 0x00. C - Hello, World

 * Shell scripts for saving files at various stages of the compilation process
 * C files using puts, printf, and sizeof

 ### 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

 C files using if/else conditions as well as for and while loops to print various outputs.

 ### 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

 C files using nested loops to recreate standard library functions

 ### 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops

 More C files using nested loops to recreate standard library functions as well as print specific outputs such as the classic "fizzbuzz" test

 ### 0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

 C files using pointers, arrays, and strings to recreate standard library functions

 ### 0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

 C files using pointers, arrays, and strings to recreate standard library functions

 ### 0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

 C files using pointers, arrays, and strings to recreate standard library functions

 ### 0x07. C - Recursion

 C files using recursion to perform various tasks such as checking if a given string is a palindrome

 ### 0x08-static_libraries

 Custom static library containing many functions from 0x00 - 0x07, as well as a script for creating a custom library

 ### 0x09-argc_argv

 C files using arguments to main to perform basic tasks

 ### 0x0A-malloc_free

 C files using malloc to dynamically allocate memory for various datatypes and tasks

 ### 0x0B-more_malloc_free

 C files using malloc to dynamically allocate memory for somewhat more advanced tasks (generally)
